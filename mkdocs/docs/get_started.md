# Getting Started

A guide to understand the workflows and submodules of SCI-VCF for summarizing, comparing, visualizing and analysing your VCF files.


## Summarize 

The summary of a VCF file is generated by classifying variants and summing up unique entries in each category.<br>

### Summarize Submodules

+ Upload VCF: Click the browse button and upload a VCF file.
+ Overall Summary: Get an overall summary of the distribution of variants in each variant type.
+ Summary Distribution: Visualize the distribution of different variant metrics along different contigs.
+ Summary Comparison: Compare the distribution of variant metrics with each other.
+ Variant Distribution: Visualize the occurrence of variants in different genomic ranges.
+ SNP Distribution: Plot the count for all 12 possible SNP types in the VCF.
+ INDEL Distribution: Plot the size distribution of INDELs in the VCF
+ Download Summary: Extract the results as a tabular dataset for further analysis.


## Compare

Unique and common variants in two VCF files are identified by using the first eight mandatory columns as two-dimensional heterogeneous tabular datasets.
